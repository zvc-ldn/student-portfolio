            <p>
                    <u>Personal Profile:</u><br>
                    I am a hardworking student who has gained many skills working as a private tutor, a volunteer at an Ice-rink and working in Keating Estates concurrently with JD sports. These skills include understanding the value and importance of being punctual, providing excellent customer service and working in a team environment as well as being efficient and productive when working individually. I consider myself a confident individual with excellent social, communication and people-skills, owing to my time volunteering and time spent as a member of my local theatre, where I was cast in several productions. Whilst attending the NCS Challenge, I also undertook a course in public speaking. My interest in Digital Media and Adverting developed from my passion for graphic design and how it can be used as an effective tool for business.
